# Fibonacci Breathing Visualizer

This is a tool to aid in Fibonacci breathing. Fibonacci breathing is where you fully inhale, hold, exhale, and hold, counting each as a fibonacci number. If you have a sequence of fibonacci numbers **[a b c d]**, you will inhale for **c** seconds, hold for **b** seconds, exhale for **d** seconds, and hold for **a** seconds.

This is a work-in-progress. Soon I'll have controls for the times.
